\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This document outlines how we would like the user interface to look and function for the web app used to mount our spectral image simulator. Outlines free paramaters presented to the user, and the type of form used to present them and the various levels and options presented based off of user inmput. Primarilly the data entry is split into 3 parts, the parameters concerning the simulation itself, those assiciated with the observation and the parameters affecting the object / objects being viewed. The object part of the form in particular will be dynamic, adjusting to teh users demands so that the pertinent fields only pop up when needed.
